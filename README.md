Welcome to MUHAN, my simple python based programming 	language


So, first of all you want to download the whole folder from MUHAN repository from my github account. It’s very important that you download all the files in order for this to work!


Commands:

To start the language, open a terminal in the folder where the files are located.  In the terminal type: 

python exec.py
	
	or

python3 exec.py

simbols for operations:

“+” sum
“-”  subtracct
“*” multiply
“/” divide
“~” square root
“!” factorial
“L” or “l” logarithm

you can:
- add two numbers: 5 + 3 = 8
-subtract : 	        5 – 3 = 2
-multiply:                5 * 3 = 15
-divide:                   5 / 3 = 1.6666666666666667
-square root:           ~49 = 7
-factorial:                3! = 3 * 2 * 1
-logarithm:             l(100, 10) = 2 or L(100, 10) =  2

variables:
integer: ex: 2, -5, 10
float:     ex: 2.5 

Small example of  the running program:
